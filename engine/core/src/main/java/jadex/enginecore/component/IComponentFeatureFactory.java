 *  A component feature is a pluggable part of the state and behavior
 *  of a component.
 *  This interface follows the prototype-instance-pattern and represents
 *  the type level (i.e. factory) as well as the instance level.
 *  
 *  The feature can inject parameters for expression evaluation
 *  using the value fetcher super interface. The fetch order is the reverse
 *  init order, i.e., later features can override values from earlier features.
