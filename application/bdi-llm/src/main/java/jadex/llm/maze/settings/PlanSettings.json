The Object needs to be cast into a $Belief$, that contains Objects. The first Object in the List is a java.awt.Point with name mazePosition, it contains x and y from agent. Second Object is a org.json.simple.JSONObject named envView, it has 4 keys (left, back, front, right), each key contains a list of integer Values. Each value encodes a state in the maze. 0 = nothing, 1 = Wall, 2 = Food, 3 = Start, 4 = End. The length of the list can be up to 3 values, this is the view distance you can not pass fields with the value 1. The third Object is java Object named brain. Write a function that is used inside a for-loop. After every Step you can plan your next step, if you need some memory, you can use the brain variable. The goal is to find the End. Create a variable outputList $Belief$. Add updated Position (left, back, front, right) as java.awt.Point, direction as a String and brain as an Object to the outputList and return."
