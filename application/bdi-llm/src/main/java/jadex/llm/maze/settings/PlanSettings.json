The function get a $Belief$ of Objects. Create a variable outputList of type $Belief$ of Objects. The program function is part of an algorithm, that is used to solve a maze. Inside the maze is a start and end position. The goal is to reach the end position. The function is running inside a for loop. Each loop is one step you can perform. The first Object in the List is a Maze.Cell with name mazePosition, it contains only x and y coordinates and you can get these with getX and getY. In the maze you have walls ont the top, right, bottom and left that are represented trough a boolean. If the Wall is false you can go to the next Cell if not you have to look for another wall. Add updated Position as Maze.Cell to the outputList and return."
