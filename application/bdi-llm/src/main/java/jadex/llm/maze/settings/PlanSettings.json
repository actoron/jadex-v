The function get a $Belief$ of Objects. Create a variable outputList of type $Belief$ of Objects. The program function is part of an algorithm, that is used to solve a maze. Inside the maze is a start and end Cell. The goal is to reach the end position. The function is running inside a for loop. Each loop is one step you can perform. The first Object in the List is a Maze.Cell with name mazePosition, it contains only int x and int y as coordinates. You can call the x and y with getX and getY. Every Cell in the maze have either walls on the top, right, bottom or left. The walls are represented trough a boolean. If it is false you can go to the next Cell, if true you have to choose another wall. Add an updated Position as Maze.Cell to the outputList and return."
