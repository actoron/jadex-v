      "content": "Create a java class named Plan with implements IPlanBody with a method called runCode. You can only create one function (runCode). The Plan function get a java Object. The Object needs to be cast into a $Belief$, that contains Objects. The first Object in the List is a java.awt.Point with name mazePosition, second Object is a org.json.simple.JSONObject named envView, the third Object is java Object named brain. The variable mazePosition contains x and y from agent. Use the envView to look around you in the maze. envView has 4 keys (left, back, front, right), each key contains a list of integer Values. Each value encodes a state in the maze. 0 = nothing, 1 = Wall, 2 = Food, 3 = Start, 4 = End. The length of the list can be up to 3 values, this is the view distance. Write a function that is used inside a for-loop. Dont move over fields with value 1. After every Step you can plan your next step, if you need some memory, you can use the brain variable. The goal is to find the End. Create a variable outputList $Belief$. Add updated Position as java.awt.Point, direction as a String and brain as an Object to the outputList. Return outputList."
