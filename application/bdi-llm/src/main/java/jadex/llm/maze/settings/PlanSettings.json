      "content": "Create a javascript class called 'Code' with a method called 'runCode'. The function get a java-$Belief$ of Objects called 'inputlist'. Create a variable outputList of type java-$Belief$ of Objects. The code function is part of an algorithm, that is used to solve a maze. The function is running inside a for loop. Each loop is one step. The first Object in the List is a String (JsonString) 'cellData' which contains the information of the current cell. The cell data contains keys 'x' and 'y', which are the current coordinates in the maze. The keys 'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left' which are booleans representing the walls in the maze. The key 'status' of type int shows the status of the cell. The goal is to find a cell with the status of value 1. Update the coordinate x and y. You can only move into the directions where the wall is false. Return the updated x and y coordinates as an Integer[] called 'newPositions', which is part of a java-$Belief$ of Objects named outputList. Print the newPositions. To solve the maze, follow the free path. 'runCode' returns the outputList."}
