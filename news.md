### Added IComponent.run()

Added method IComponent.run(pojo) to execute functional tasks using
components. A component is created, executes the task and sets a result.
If the pojo implements IResultProvider, the component will automatically
be terminated after the first result is received. See micro applications
'breakfast' for an example.
